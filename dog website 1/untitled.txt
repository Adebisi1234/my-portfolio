Poodles ..Standard-Poodle
The fluffy and “foo-foo” appearance of poodles hardly conjures up what poodles were originally bred to do—retrieve prey from the water <br> but all that fur (which is actually hair) protects joints from the cold water. <br> Their hair doesn’t shed too much or produce too much dander <br> so they’re often great companions for allergy sufferers  <br> who want a snuggler, <br> which suits the poodle just fine because they assume they are a member of your family and prefer quality time with you.



French bulldog ..
Look at those cute big ears! <br> That smooshed in face is irresistibly cute, but it can cause some breathing issues. <br> The Frenchie is a brachycephalic breed, <br> which means its shorter snouts make breathing a little more laborious, <br> especially in hot weather or if your Frenchie takes a dip in the lake. <br> But the Frenchie’s natural inclination to be a champion couch potato suits it’s breathing condition so it won’t have issues there. <br> When they do want to cool off and relax they lay with their legs splayed out behind them, earning another nickname, “Frog Dog.” 



Labrador retriever ..
The Labrador retriever is a super friendly and easy-going breed and an ideal family dog, <br> which is probably why it topped the American Kennel Club’s list of (AKC) most popular dog breeds for the last five years. <br> These puppies, undeniably one of the cutest dog breeds, <br> grow fast and reach adulthood by about six months and crave an active lifestyle to be happy and healthy. <br> The only dilemma is which lab puppy is the cutest—black, yellow, or chocolate?



Beagle ..
It’s probably one of the cutest dog breeds <br> because the beagle keeps its adorable puppy face for most of its life—until those gray hairs eventually creep in around its face. <br> These pups are motivated by scent and an ever-present curiosity that is driven by their keen sense of smell and the desire to chase down any scent that intrigues them. <br> Roaming and exploring are genetic so they feel their best with a family that loves an active lifestyle outdoors.



German shepherd ..Germanshepherd
Known for their keen intelligence, high energy, and loyalty, <br> the German Shepherd is one of the most popular breeds of dog in the world. <br> Despite their fearsome reputation, most owners find they are loyal, docile, obedient, and a loving family pet. <br> It is because of their intelligence that German Shepherds are trained for military service, search and rescue, and police dogs. <br> After World War I, returning soldiers spoke so highly of this breed that their popularity exploded in the United States.
